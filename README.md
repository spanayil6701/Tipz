Submitted by: Sachin Panayil

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

* [x] Implementation of UISlider to select tip percentage
* [x] Updated UI
* [x] Implementation of a bill splitter feature
* [x] Use of UIStepper to select a number
* [x] Use of segue to navigate between view controllers

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  - Connecting the IBOutlets to produce data was something I struggled with, but the main thing I struggled with was pushing it to Github. It wouldnt let me no matter how many fixes I used. There error "No Resources Found" would plague my screen. I aplogize if the format it was uploaded in is bad but I had no other choice. The files that would normally appear on the repository are located in the Tipz.zip file. Also for some reason, the two gifs I tried to upload would not show up. Only one would show up. So I attached a demo of the app in the TipzDemo.zip file.
